### Cars
This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
 The user will be presented with a menu of three options:
1. Add a new car to the file
2. List the cars in the inventory file in order of year
3. Quit

If they choose to add a *new car* they will be prompted for the year, make, and model.
